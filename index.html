                                <p class="mb-0">Vitex trifolia is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae,
                                    also known as three-leaf beggarticks or three-part beggarticks. Clusters of the
                                    plant's tiny, golden blooms are produced. The flowers are shaped like discs and are
                                    encircled by a number of bracts. Following flowering, the plant releases tiny seeds
                                    with barbed ends that make it simple for them to cling to clothing, feathers, or
                                    fur, aiding in their spread.Three-leaf Beggarticks are significant ecologically
                                    because they serve as a source of food for some insects and birds.

                                    native to parts of South Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, however it
                                    is not a commonly known or well-researched species.The Leo Tree can grow to a height
                                    of around 10 to 20 metres (33 to 66 feet), which is a moderate height. Large, glossy
                                    leaves and small, rounded fig fruits that become scarlet when ripe are what make
